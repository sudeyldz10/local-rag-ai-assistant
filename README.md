## Features

- **Multi-format document loading** — supports `.txt`, `.pdf`, and `.docx` files
- **Recursive folder scanning** — automatically scans all subfolders for documents
- **Text chunking and preprocessing** — smart splitting with configurable chunk size and overlap
- **Embedding generation** — semantic vector representations via Foundry Local SDK
- **Embedding persistence** — embeddings saved to SQLite database, no recalculation on restart
- **Semantic similarity search** — finds the most relevant chunks for each query
- **Smart retrieval pipeline** — candidate pre-filtering, relative score filtering (%75 rule), and source preference for follow-up queries
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** — grounds LLM answers in your documents
- **Conversation history** — remembers previous questions within a session; follow-up queries are automatically enriched with prior context
- **Confidence-based early exit** — if retrieved chunks fall below the confidence threshold, the LLM is skipped and a clear "not enough info" message is returned instead
- **Source filtering** — use `[foldername]` tag to search only within a specific folder
- **Environment-based config** — document path set via `.env`, no hardcoded paths
- **Local LLM integration** — via Microsoft Foundry Local SDK, no cloud required
- **`<think>` token suppression** — Qwen model internal reasoning is stripped from output
- **Modular project architecture** — clean separation of ingestion, retrieval, and generation
- **Fully offline workflow** — your data never leaves your machine

## How It Works

```
Your Documents (TXT / PDF / DOCX)
        │
        ▼
  [ Document Loader ]  →  recursive folder scan
        │
        ▼
  [ Text Splitter ]  →  overlapping chunks
        │
        ▼
  [ Embedding Generator ]  →  vectors via Foundry Local
        │
        ▼
  [ Embedding Store ]  →  saved to vector/embeddings.db (SQLite)
        │
   User Query
        │
        ▼
  [ Query Enrichment ]  →  follow-up queries enriched with conversation history
        │
        ▼
  [ Retriever ]  →  top-k candidates (with optional source filter)
        │
        ▼
  [ Score Filtering ]
    ├─ Absolute threshold  (min_score_threshold = 0.45)
    └─ Relative filter     (%75 rule — drops chunks far below best score)
        │
        ▼
  [ Confidence Check ]  →  if score < 0.60, skip LLM and return early message
        │
        ▼
  [ LLM (Foundry Local) ]
        │
        ▼
  [ <think> suppression ]  →  strips internal reasoning from Qwen output
        │
        ▼
     Answer + Source Citation ✓
```

## Configuration (`app/config.py`)

| Parameter | Value | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `retrieval_candidate_k` | `10` | Initial candidate pool size before filtering |
| `min_score_threshold` | `0.45` | Absolute minimum — chunks below this are discarded |
| `min_confidence_score` | `0.60` | If top score is below this on ambiguous queries, LLM is not called |

---

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sudeyldz10/local-rag-ai-assistant.git
cd local-rag-ai-assistant
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Set your documents folder in `.env`:
```
DOCS_PATH=/path/to/your/documents
```

Run the assistant:
```bash
python app/main.py
```

---

## Usage

**Basic question:**
```
Question > What is the Mean Value Theorem?
```

**Filter by folder:**
```
Question > [math210] implicit function theorem nedir?
```

Only documents inside the `math210` folder will be searched.

## What I Learned

Building this project gave me hands-on experience with:

- RAG architecture and how retrieval improves LLM accuracy
- Working with vector embeddings and cosine similarity search
- Parsing multiple document formats (TXT, PDF, DOCX) in Python
- Integrating a local LLM through the Microsoft Foundry Local SDK
- Designing a modular, layered Python project from scratch
- Debugging import errors, module structure issues, and model initialization
- Building a fully offline AI system with zero external API calls
- Storing and querying structured data with SQLite
- Tuning retrieval quality with score thresholds and relative filtering strategies
- Making follow-up queries work correctly by enriching them with prior context

---

## Challenges I Faced

- Handling different document encodings and formats consistently
- Getting the Foundry Local SDK initialized correctly (`alias` vs `name` attribute)
- Tuning chunk size and overlap for better retrieval quality
- Structuring the project so each module stays independent and testable
- Suppressing `<think>` reasoning tokens from Qwen model output using regex
- Scanned PDFs returning only `\n` characters — solved with a minimum content length filter
- Unrelated documents scoring high in retrieval — solved with source filtering and relative score filter
- Large embedding models (8b) being too slow for local use — reverted to `qwen3-embedding-0.6b`
- Preventing hallucination on vague queries — solved with confidence-based early exit before LLM call
- Follow-up queries losing context — solved by enriching queries with conversation history

---

## Future Improvements

- Streaming responses in real time
- Desktop GUI interface (Gradio)
- Better retrieval ranking (hybrid search: BM25 + semantic)
- Re-ranking with a cross-encoder model
- Support for more formats (Markdown, HTML, CSV)

---

## Example Use Cases

- Ask questions about your lecture notes and textbooks
- Build a private, offline knowledge base from your own documents
- Summarize long documents without sending data to the cloud
- Filter searches by subject folder for more precise answers
